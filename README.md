Event Scheduling is a web-based software for organizing envelopes, conferences, fest, expos and other events. You can schedule an event by dividing it into days, zones and events. Using the drag and drop interface, you can easily change the time, location, and duration of an event. Automatic sorting and time correction will allow you to easily distribute many events.

The event schedule can be run in a browser and does not require installation of additional software and registration, the schedule is saved in JSON format, which allows you to use the data in other software. All data is processed and stored only on your device.
